\section*{Projects and Research}
\textbf{ATLAS-ITk PhysPi Environmental Monitoring System \textbar{} Carleton University}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fourth year honours project in Physics, 2017/2018.
\item Worked with the Carleton University ATLAS-ITk research team to aid in the development and construction of silicon microstrip sensors.
\item Designed, developed and implemented an environmental monitoring system called PhysPi for use in the cleanroom where sensors are currently being tested and constructed.
\item Via programming and hardware connections, two digital temperature and humdity sensors were connected to an Arduino Uno board for data readout, then sent to a Raspberry Pi 3B for data analysis, storage and eventual display on a user-friendly webpage.
